# üìÅ Async `pathlib` for Python
`aiopath` is a complete implementation of Python's [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) that's compatible with [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), [`trio`](https://github.com/python-trio/trio), and the [`async/await` syntax](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/). 

All I/O performed by `aiopath` is asynchronous and [awaitable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#awaitables).

Check out [`üìÇ app_paths`](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/app_paths) for an example of library that uses `aiopath`, as well as the [`pyclean` script here](https://alexdelorenzo.dev/notes/pyclean).

## Use case
If you're writing asynchronous Python code and want to take advantage of `pathlib`'s conveniences, but don't want to mix blocking and [non-blocking I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O), then you can reach for `aiopath`.

For example, if you're writing an async [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) script, you might want to make several concurrent requests to websites and save the responses to persistent storage:
```python3
from asyncio import run, gather

from aiohttp import ClientSession
from aiopath import AsyncPath


async def save_page(url: str, name: str):
  path = AsyncPath(name)

  if await path.exists():
    return

  async with ClientSession() as session, session.get(url) as response:
    content: bytes = await response.read()

  await path.write_bytes(content)


async def main():
  urls = [
    'https://example.com',
    'https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/aiopath',
    'https://alexdelorenzo.dev',
    'https://dupebot.firstbyte.dev'
  ]

  tasks = (
    save_page(url, f'{index}.html')
    for index, url in enumerate(urls)
  )

  await gather(*tasks)


run(main())
```
If you used `pathlib` instead of `aiopath`, tasks accessing the disk would block the event loop, and async tasks accessing the network would suspend until the event loop was unblocked.

By using `aiopath`, the script can access the network and disk concurrently.

## Implementation 
`aiopath` is a direct reimplementation of [CPython's `pathlib.py`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/pathlib.py) and shares some of its code. `aiopath`'s class hierarchy [directly matches the one from `pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html), where `Path` inherits from `PurePath`, `AsyncPath` inherits from `AsyncPurePath`, and so on.

With `aiopath`, methods that perform I/O are asynchronous and awaitable, and methods that perform I/O and return iterators in `pathlib` now return [async generators](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0525/). `aiopath` goes one step further, and wraps [`os.scandir()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir) and [`DirEntry`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.DirEntry) to make [`AsyncPath.glob()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob) completely async.

`aiopath` is typed with Python [type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), and if using the `aiofile` back end, it takes advantage of [`libaio`](https://pagure.io/libaio) for async I/O on Linux.

# Usage
 `aiopath`'s API directly matches [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html), so check out the standard library documentation for [`PurePath`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pure-paths) and [`Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods).
 
### Running examples
To run the following examples with top-level `await` expressions, [launch an asynchronous Python REPL](https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/python-asyncio/#running-async-code-in-the-repl) using `python3 -m asyncio` or an [IPython shell](https://ipython.org/).

You'll also need to install `asynctempfile` via PyPI, like so `python3 -m pip install asynctempfile`.

## Replacing `pathlib`
All of `pathlib.Path`'s methods that perform synchronous I/O are reimplemented as asynchronous methods. `PurePath` methods are not asynchronous because they don't perform I/O.

```python3
from pathlib import Path

from asynctempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
from aiopath import AsyncPath


async with NamedTemporaryFile() as temp:
  path = Path(temp.name)
  apath = AsyncPath(temp.name)

  # check existence
  ## sync
  assert path.exists()
  ## async
  assert await apath.exists()

  # check if file
  ## sync
  assert path.is_file()
  ## async
  assert await apath.is_file()

  # touch
  path.touch()
  await apath.touch()

  # PurePath methods are not async
  assert path.is_absolute() == apath.is_absolute()
  assert path.as_uri() == apath.as_uri()

  # read and write text
  text: str = 'example'
  await apath.write_text(text)
  assert await apath.read_text() == text

assert not path.exists()
assert not await apath.exists()
```

You can convert `pathlib.Path` objects to `aiopath.AsyncPath` objects, and vice versa:
```python3
from pathlib import Path
from aiopath import AsyncPath


home: Path = Path.home()
ahome: AsyncPath = AsyncPath(home)
path: Path = Path(ahome)

assert isinstance(home, Path)
assert isinstance(ahome, AsyncPath)
assert isinstance(path, Path)

# AsyncPath and Path objects can point to the same file
assert str(home) == str(ahome) == str(path)

# AsyncPath and Path objects are equivalent
assert home == ahome
```

`AsyncPath` is a subclass of `Path` and `PurePath`, and a subclass of `AsyncPurePath`:
```python3
from pathlib import Path, PurePath
from aiopath import AsyncPath, AsyncPurePath


assert issubclass(AsyncPath, Path)
assert issubclass(AsyncPath, PurePath)
assert issubclass(AsyncPath, AsyncPurePath)
assert issubclass(AsyncPurePath, PurePath)

path: AsyncPath = await AsyncPath.home()

assert isinstance(path, Path)
assert isinstance(path, PurePath)
assert isinstance(path, AsyncPurePath) 
```

Check out the test files in the [`tests` directory](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/aiopath/blob/main/tests) for more examples of how `aiopath` compares to `pathlib`.

## Opening a file
You can get an asynchronous [file-like object handle](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object) by using [asynchronous context managers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-context-managers). 

`AsyncPath.open()`'s async context manager yields an [`anyio.AsyncFile`](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#async-file-i-o) object.

```python3
from asynctempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
from aiopath import AsyncPath


text: str = 'example'

# you can access a file with async context managers
async with NamedTemporaryFile() as temp:
  path = AsyncPath(temp.name)

  async with path.open(mode='w') as file:
    await file.write(text)

  async with path.open(mode='r') as file:
    result: str = await file.read()

  assert result == text

# or you can use the read/write convenience methods
async with NamedTemporaryFile() as temp:
  path = AsyncPath(temp.name)

  await path.write_text(text)
  result: str = await path.read_text()
  assert result == text

  content: bytes = text.encode()

  await path.write_bytes(content)
  result: bytes = await path.read_bytes()
  assert result == content
```

## [Globbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming))
`aiopath` implements [`pathlib` globbing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob) using async I/O and async generators.

```python3
from aiopath import AsyncPath


home: AsyncPath = await AsyncPath.home()

async for path in home.glob('*'):
  assert isinstance(path, AsyncPath)
  print(path)

downloads: AsyncPath = home / 'Downloads'

if await downloads.exists():
  # this might take a while
  paths: list[AsyncPath] = \
    [path async for path in downloads.glob('**/*')]
```
